<div class='p'>

<span class="verse" id="DN1_1">1&#160;</span>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it. 
<span class="verse" id="DN1_2">2&#160;</span>The Lord<a href='#FN1' epub:type='noteref' class='noteref'>*</a> gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with some of the vessels of the house of God;<a href='#FN2' epub:type='noteref' class='noteref'>†</a> and he carried them into the land of Shinar to the house of his god. He brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN1_3">3&#160;</span>The king spoke to Ashpenaz, the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring in some of the children of Israel, even of the royal offspring<a href='#FN3' epub:type='noteref' class='noteref'>‡</a> and of the nobles: 
<span class="verse" id="DN1_4">4&#160;</span>youths in whom was no defect, but well-favored, skillful in all wisdom, endowed with knowledge, understanding science, and who had the ability to stand in the king’s palace; and that he should teach them the learning and the language of the Chaldeans. 
<span class="verse" id="DN1_5">5&#160;</span>The king appointed for them a daily portion of the king’s delicacies and of the wine which he drank, and that they should be nourished three years, that at its end they should stand before the king. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN1_6">6&#160;</span>Now among these of the children of Judah were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. 
<span class="verse" id="DN1_7">7&#160;</span>The prince of the eunuchs gave names to them: to Daniel he gave the name Belteshazzar; to Hananiah, Shadrach; to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abednego. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN1_8">8&#160;</span>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king’s delicacies, nor with the wine which he drank. Therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. 
<span class="verse" id="DN1_9">9&#160;</span>Now God made Daniel find kindness and compassion in the sight of the prince of the eunuchs. 
<span class="verse" id="DN1_10">10&#160;</span>The prince of the eunuchs said to Daniel, “I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your food and your drink. For why should he see your faces worse looking than the youths who are of your own age? Then you would endanger my head with the king.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN1_11">11&#160;</span>Then Daniel said to the steward whom the prince of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: 
<span class="verse" id="DN1_12">12&#160;</span>“Test your servants, I beg you, ten days; and let them give us vegetables to eat and water to drink. 
<span class="verse" id="DN1_13">13&#160;</span>Then let our faces be examined before you, and the face of the youths who eat of the king’s delicacies; and as you see, deal with your servants.” 
<span class="verse" id="DN1_14">14&#160;</span>So he listened to them in this matter, and tested them for ten days. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN1_15">15&#160;</span>At the end of ten days, their faces appeared fairer and they were fatter in flesh than all the youths who ate of the king’s delicacies. 
<span class="verse" id="DN1_16">16&#160;</span>So the steward took away their delicacies and the wine that they were given to drink, and gave them vegetables. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN1_17">17&#160;</span>Now as for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN1_18">18&#160;</span>At the end of the days which the king had appointed for bringing them in, the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. 
<span class="verse" id="DN1_19">19&#160;</span>The king talked with them; and among them all was found no one like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. Therefore stood they before the king. 
<span class="verse" id="DN1_20">20&#160;</span>In every matter of wisdom and understanding concerning which the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters who were in all his realm. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN1_21">21&#160;</span>Daniel continued even to the first year of king Cyrus.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='DN2_0'>2</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN2_1">1&#160;</span>In the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams; and his spirit was troubled, and his sleep went from him. 
<span class="verse" id="DN2_2">2&#160;</span>Then the king commanded that the magicians, the enchanters, the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans be called to tell the king his dreams. So they came in and stood before the king. 
<span class="verse" id="DN2_3">3&#160;</span>The king said to them, “I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN2_4">4&#160;</span>Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in the Syrian language, “O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN2_5">5&#160;</span>The king answered the Chaldeans, “The thing has gone from me. If you don’t make known to me the dream and its interpretation, you will be cut in pieces, and your houses will be made a dunghill. 
<span class="verse" id="DN2_6">6&#160;</span>But if you show the dream and its interpretation, you will receive from me gifts, rewards, and great honor. Therefore show me the dream and its interpretation.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN2_7">7&#160;</span>They answered the second time and said, “Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN2_8">8&#160;</span>The king answered, “I know of a certainty that you are trying to gain time, because you see the thing has gone from me. 
<span class="verse" id="DN2_9">9&#160;</span>But if you don’t make known to me the dream, there is but one law for you; for you have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, until the situation changes. Therefore tell me the dream, and I will know that you can show me its interpretation.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN2_10">10&#160;</span>The Chaldeans answered the king and said, “There is not a man on the earth who can show the king’s matter, because no king, lord, or ruler has asked such a thing of any magician, enchanter, or Chaldean. 
<span class="verse" id="DN2_11">11&#160;</span>It is a rare thing that the king requires, and there is no other who can show it before the king except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN2_12">12&#160;</span>Because of this, the king was angry and very furious, and commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be destroyed. 
<span class="verse" id="DN2_13">13&#160;</span>So the decree went out, and the wise men were to be slain. They sought Daniel and his companions to be slain. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN2_14">14&#160;</span>Then Daniel returned answer with counsel and prudence to Arioch the captain of the king’s guard, who had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon. 
<span class="verse" id="DN2_15">15&#160;</span>He answered Arioch the king’s captain, “Why is the decree so urgent from the king?” Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel. 
<span class="verse" id="DN2_16">16&#160;</span>Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would appoint him a time, and he would show the king the interpretation. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN2_17">17&#160;</span>Then Daniel went to his house and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions: 
<span class="verse" id="DN2_18">18&#160;</span>that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret, that Daniel and his companions would not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. 
<span class="verse" id="DN2_19">19&#160;</span>Then the secret was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven. 
<span class="verse" id="DN2_20">20&#160;</span>Daniel answered, </div>
<div class='q'>“Blessed be the name of God forever and ever; </div>
<div class='q2'>for wisdom and might are his. </div>
<div class='q'>
<span class="verse" id="DN2_21">21&#160;</span>He changes the times and the seasons. </div>
<div class='q2'>He removes kings and sets up kings. </div>
<div class='q'>He gives wisdom to the wise, </div>
<div class='q2'>and knowledge to those who have understanding. </div>
<div class='q'>
<span class="verse" id="DN2_22">22&#160;</span>He reveals the deep and secret things. </div>
<div class='q2'>He knows what is in the darkness, </div>
<div class='q2'>and the light dwells with him. </div>
<div class='q'>
<span class="verse" id="DN2_23">23&#160;</span>I thank you and praise you, </div>
<div class='q2'>O God of my fathers, </div>
<div class='q'>who have given me wisdom and might, </div>
<div class='q2'>and have now made known to me what we desired of you; </div>
<div class='q2'>for you have made known to us the king’s matter.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN2_24">24&#160;</span>Therefore Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon. He went and said this to him: “Don’t destroy the wise men of Babylon. Bring me in before the king, and I will show to the king the interpretation.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN2_25">25&#160;</span>Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said this to him: “I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Judah who will make known to the king the interpretation.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN2_26">26&#160;</span>The king answered Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, “Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen, and its interpretation?” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN2_27">27&#160;</span>Daniel answered before the king, and said, “The secret which the king has demanded can’t be shown to the king by wise men, enchanters, magicians, or soothsayers; 
<span class="verse" id="DN2_28">28&#160;</span>but there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and he has made known to king Nebuchadnezzar what will be in the latter days. Your dream and the visions of your head on your bed are these: </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN2_29">29&#160;</span>“As for you, O king, your thoughts came on your bed, what should happen hereafter; and he who reveals secrets has made known to you what will happen. 
<span class="verse" id="DN2_30">30&#160;</span>But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that you may know the thoughts of your heart. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN2_31">31&#160;</span>“You, O king, saw, and behold,<a href='#FN4' epub:type='noteref' class='noteref'>*</a> a great image. This image, which was mighty, and whose brightness was excellent, stood before you; and its appearance was terrifying. 
<span class="verse" id="DN2_32">32&#160;</span>As for this image, its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of bronze, 
<span class="verse" id="DN2_33">33&#160;</span>its legs of iron, its feet part of iron and part of clay. 
<span class="verse" id="DN2_34">34&#160;</span>You saw until a stone was cut out without hands, which struck the image on its feet that were of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces. 
<span class="verse" id="DN2_35">35&#160;</span>Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors. The wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them. The stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN2_36">36&#160;</span>“This is the dream; and we will tell its interpretation before the king. 
<span class="verse" id="DN2_37">37&#160;</span>You, O king, are king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, the strength, and the glory. 
<span class="verse" id="DN2_38">38&#160;</span>Wherever the children of men dwell, he has given the animals of the field and the birds of the sky into your hand, and has made you rule over them all. You are the head of gold. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN2_39">39&#160;</span>“After you, another kingdom will arise that is inferior to you; and another third kingdom of bronze, which will rule over all the earth. 
<span class="verse" id="DN2_40">40&#160;</span>The fourth kingdom will be strong as iron, because iron breaks in pieces and subdues all things; and as iron that crushes all these, it will break in pieces and crush. 
<span class="verse" id="DN2_41">41&#160;</span>Whereas you saw the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay and part of iron, it will be a divided kingdom; but there will be in it of the strength of the iron, because you saw the iron mixed with miry clay. 
<span class="verse" id="DN2_42">42&#160;</span>As the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle. 
<span class="verse" id="DN2_43">43&#160;</span>Whereas you saw the iron mixed with miry clay, they will mingle themselves with the seed of men; but they won’t cling to one another, even as iron does not mix with clay. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN2_44">44&#160;</span>“In the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which will never be destroyed, nor will its sovereignty be left to another people; but it will break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it will stand forever. 
<span class="verse" id="DN2_45">45&#160;</span>Because you saw that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold, the great God has made known to the king what will happen hereafter. The dream is certain, and its interpretation sure.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN2_46">46&#160;</span>Then king Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, worshiped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an offering and sweet odors to him. 
<span class="verse" id="DN2_47">47&#160;</span>The king answered to Daniel, and said, “Of a truth your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, since you have been able to reveal this secret.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN2_48">48&#160;</span>Then the king made Daniel great and gave him many great gifts, and made him rule over the whole province of Babylon and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon. 
<span class="verse" id="DN2_49">49&#160;</span>Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon, but Daniel was in the king’s gate.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='DN3_0'>3</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN3_1">1&#160;</span>Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits<a href='#FN5' epub:type='noteref' class='noteref'>*</a> and its width six cubits. He set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon. 
<span class="verse" id="DN3_2">2&#160;</span>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the local governors, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. 
<span class="verse" id="DN3_3">3&#160;</span>Then the local governors, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces were gathered together to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN3_4">4&#160;</span>Then the herald cried aloud, “To you it is commanded, peoples, nations, and languages, 
<span class="verse" id="DN3_5">5&#160;</span>that whenever you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music, you fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up. 
<span class="verse" id="DN3_6">6&#160;</span>Whoever doesn’t fall down and worship shall be cast into the middle of a burning fiery furnace the same hour.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN3_7">7&#160;</span>Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN3_8">8&#160;</span>Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near and brought accusation against the Jews. 
<span class="verse" id="DN3_9">9&#160;</span>They answered Nebuchadnezzar the king, “O king, live for ever! 
<span class="verse" id="DN3_10">10&#160;</span>You, O king, have made a decree that every man who hears the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music shall fall down and worship the golden image; 
<span class="verse" id="DN3_11">11&#160;</span>and whoever doesn’t fall down and worship shall be cast into the middle of a burning fiery furnace. 
<span class="verse" id="DN3_12">12&#160;</span>There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men, O king, have not respected you. They don’t serve your gods, and don’t worship the golden image which you have set up.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN3_13">13&#160;</span>Then Nebuchadnezzar in rage and fury commanded that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego be brought. Then these men were brought before the king. 
<span class="verse" id="DN3_14">14&#160;</span>Nebuchadnezzar answered them, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you don’t serve my gods and you don’t worship the golden image which I have set up? 
<span class="verse" id="DN3_15">15&#160;</span>Now if you are ready whenever you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music to fall down and worship the image which I have made, good; but if you don’t worship, you shall be cast the same hour into the middle of a burning fiery furnace. Who is that god who will deliver you out of my hands?” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN3_16">16&#160;</span>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered the king, “Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter. 
<span class="verse" id="DN3_17">17&#160;</span>If it happens, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king. 
<span class="verse" id="DN3_18">18&#160;</span>But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN3_19">19&#160;</span>Then Nebuchadnezzar was full of fury, and the form of his appearance was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated. 
<span class="verse" id="DN3_20">20&#160;</span>He commanded certain mighty men who were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace. 
<span class="verse" id="DN3_21">21&#160;</span>Then these men were bound in their pants, their tunics, and their mantles, and their other clothes, and were cast into the middle of the burning fiery furnace. 
<span class="verse" id="DN3_22">22&#160;</span>Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent and the furnace exceedingly hot, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. 
<span class="verse" id="DN3_23">23&#160;</span>These three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the middle of the burning fiery furnace. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN3_24">24&#160;</span>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished and rose up in haste. He spoke and said to his counselors, “Didn’t we cast three men bound into the middle of the fire?” </div>
<div class='p'>They answered the king, “True, O king.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN3_25">25&#160;</span>He answered, “Look, I see four men loose, walking in the middle of the fire, and they are unharmed. The appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN3_26">26&#160;</span>Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace. He spoke and said, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, you servants of the Most High God, come out, and come here!” </div>
<div class='p'>Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the middle of the fire. 
<span class="verse" id="DN3_27">27&#160;</span>The local governors, the deputies, and the governors, and the king’s counselors, being gathered together, saw these men, that the fire had no power on their bodies. The hair of their head wasn’t singed. Their pants weren’t changed. The smell of fire wasn’t even on them. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN3_28">28&#160;</span>Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said, “Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel and delivered his servants who trusted in him, and have changed the king’s word, and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god except their own God. 
<span class="verse" id="DN3_29">29&#160;</span>Therefore I make a decree that every people, nation, and language which speak anything evil against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill, because there is no other god who is able to deliver like this.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN3_30">30&#160;</span>Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.  </div>

<span class="verse" id="DN4_4">4&#160;</span>I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace. 
<span class="verse" id="DN4_5">5&#160;</span>I saw a dream which made me afraid; and the thoughts on my bed and the visions of my head troubled me. 
<span class="verse" id="DN4_6">6&#160;</span>Therefore I made a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream.

<span class="verse" id="DN4_10">10&#160;</span>These were the visions of my head on my bed: I saw, and behold, a tree in the middle of the earth; and its height was great. 
<span class="verse" id="DN4_11">11&#160;</span>The tree grew and was strong. Its height reached to the sky and its sight to the end of all the earth. 
<span class="verse" id="DN4_12">12&#160;</span>Its leaves were beautiful, and it had much fruit, and in it was food for all. The animals of the field had shade under it, and the birds of the sky lived in its branches, and all flesh was fed from it. </div>
<div class='pi'>
<span class="verse" id="DN4_13">13&#160;</span>“I saw in the visions of my head on my bed, and behold, a holy watcher came down from the sky. 
<span class="verse" id="DN4_14">14&#160;</span>He cried aloud and said this: ‘Cut down the tree, and cut off its branches! Shake off its leaves and scatter its fruit! Let the animals get away from under it and the birds from its branches. 
<span class="verse" id="DN4_15">15&#160;</span>Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of the sky. Let his portion be with the animals in the grass of the earth. 
<span class="verse" id="DN4_16">16&#160;</span>Let his heart be changed from man’s, and let an animal’s heart be given to him. Then let seven times pass over him. </div>

<span class="verse" id="DN4_19">19&#160;</span>Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was stricken mute for a while, and his thoughts troubled him. The king answered, “Belteshazzar, don’t let the dream or the interpretation, trouble you.” </div>

<span class="verse" id="DN4_24">24&#160;</span>“This is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which has come on my lord the king:

<span class="verse" id="DN6_4">4&#160;</span>Then the presidents and the local governors sought to find occasion against Daniel as touching the kingdom; but they could find no occasion or fault, because he was faithful. There wasn’t any error or fault found in him. 
<span class="verse" id="DN6_5">5&#160;</span>Then these men said, “We won’t find any occasion against this Daniel, unless we find it against him concerning the law of his God.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN6_6">6&#160;</span>Then these presidents and local governors assembled together to the king, and said this to him, “King Darius, live forever! 
<span class="verse" id="DN6_7">7&#160;</span>All the presidents of the kingdom, the deputies and the local governors, the counselors and the governors, have consulted together to establish a royal statute and to make a strong decree, that whoever asks a petition of any god or man for thirty days, except of you, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions. 
<span class="verse" id="DN6_8">8&#160;</span>Now, O king, establish the decree and sign the writing, that it not be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which doesn’t alter.”

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN6_10">10&#160;</span>When Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house (now his windows were open in his room toward Jerusalem) and he kneeled on his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did before. 
<span class="verse" id="DN6_11">11&#160;</span>Then these men assembled together, and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God. 
<span class="verse" id="DN6_12">12&#160;</span>Then they came near, and spoke before the king concerning the king’s decree: “Haven’t you signed a decree that every man who makes a petition to any god or man within thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?” </div>
<div class='p'>The king answered, “This thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which doesn’t alter.” </div>

<span class="verse" id="DN6_14">14&#160;</span>Then the king, when he heard these words, was very displeased, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him; and he labored until the going down of the sun to rescue him. </div>

<span class="verse" id="DN6_17">17&#160;</span>A stone was brought, and laid on the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN6_21">21&#160;</span>Then Daniel said to the king, “O king, live forever!

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN6_23">23&#160;</span>Then the king was exceedingly glad, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no kind of harm was found on him, because he had trusted in his God. </div>

<span class="verse" id="DN6_24">24&#160;</span>The king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions—them, their children, and their wives; and the lions mauled them, and broke all their bones in pieces before they came to the bottom of the den. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN6_25">25&#160;</span>Then king Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and languages who dwell in all the earth: </div>

<span class="verse" id="DN8_1">1&#160;</span>In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar, a vision appeared to me, even to me, Daniel, after that which appeared to me at the first. 
<span class="verse" id="DN8_2">2&#160;</span>I saw the vision. Now it was so, that when I saw, I was in the citadel of Susa, which is in the province of Elam. I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai. 
<span class="verse" id="DN8_3">3&#160;</span>Then I lifted up my eyes and saw, and behold, a ram which had two horns stood before the river. The two horns were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last. 
<span class="verse" id="DN8_4">4&#160;</span>I saw the ram pushing westward, northward, and southward. No animals could stand before him. There wasn’t any who could deliver out of his hand, but he did according to his will, and magnified himself. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN8_5">5&#160;</span>As I was considering, behold, a male goat came from the west over the surface of the whole earth, and didn’t touch the ground. The goat had a notable horn between his eyes. 
<span class="verse" id="DN8_6">6&#160;</span>He came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran on him in the fury of his power. 
<span class="verse" id="DN8_7">7&#160;</span>I saw him come close to the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and struck the ram, and broke his two horns. There was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground and trampled on him. There was no one who could deliver the ram out of his hand. 
<span class="verse" id="DN8_8">8&#160;</span>The male goat magnified himself exceedingly. When he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up four notable horns toward the four winds of the sky. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN8_9">9&#160;</span>Out of one of them came out a little horn which grew exceedingly great—toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious land. 
<span class="verse" id="DN8_10">10&#160;</span>It grew great, even to the army of the sky; and it cast down some of the army and of the stars to the ground and trampled on them. 
<span class="verse" id="DN8_11">11&#160;</span>Yes, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the army; and it took away from him the continual burnt offering, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down. 
<span class="verse" id="DN8_12">12&#160;</span>The army was given over to it together with the continual burnt offering through disobedience. It cast down truth to the ground, and it did its pleasure and prospered. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN8_13">13&#160;</span>Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said to that certain one who spoke, “How long will the vision about the continual burnt offering, and the disobedience that makes desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the army to be trodden under foot be?” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DN8_14">14&#160;</span>He said to me, “To two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings. Then the sanctuary will be cleansed.” </div>
