<span class="verse" id="JG1_1">1&#160;</span>After the death of Joshua, the children of Israel asked of Yahweh,<a href='#FN1' epub:type='noteref' class='noteref'>*</a> saying, “Who should go up for us first against the Canaanites, to fight against them?” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG1_2">2&#160;</span>Yahweh said, “Judah shall go up. Behold,<a href='#FN2' epub:type='noteref' class='noteref'>†</a> I have delivered the land into his hand.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG1_3">3&#160;</span>Judah said to Simeon his brother, “Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with you into your lot.” So Simeon went with him. 
<span class="verse" id="JG1_4">4&#160;</span>Judah went up, and Yahweh delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand. They struck ten thousand men in Bezek. 
<span class="verse" id="JG1_5">5&#160;</span>They found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek, and they fought against him. They struck the Canaanites and the Perizzites. 
<span class="verse" id="JG1_6">6&#160;</span>But Adoni-Bezek fled. They pursued him, caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his big toes. 
<span class="verse" id="JG1_7">7&#160;</span>Adoni-Bezek said, “Seventy kings, having their thumbs and their big toes cut off, scavenged under my table. As I have done, so God<a href='#FN3' epub:type='noteref' class='noteref'>‡</a> has done to me.” They brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there. 
<span class="verse" id="JG1_8">8&#160;</span>The children of Judah fought against Jerusalem, took it, struck it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG1_9">9&#160;</span>After that, the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, and in the South, and in the lowland. 
<span class="verse" id="JG1_10">10&#160;</span>Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron. (The name of Hebron before that was Kiriath Arba.) They struck Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG1_11">11&#160;</span>From there he went against the inhabitants of Debir. (The name of Debir before that was Kiriath Sepher.) 
<span class="verse" id="JG1_12">12&#160;</span>Caleb said, “I will give Achsah my daughter as wife to the man who strikes Kiriath Sepher, and takes it.” 
<span class="verse" id="JG1_13">13&#160;</span>Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it, so he gave him Achsah his daughter as his wife. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG1_14">14&#160;</span>When she came, she got him to ask her father for a field. She got off her donkey; and Caleb said to her, “What would you like?” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG1_15">15&#160;</span>She said to him, “Give me a blessing; because you have set me in the land of the South, give me also springs of water.” Then Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs. 
<span class="verse" id="JG1_16">16&#160;</span>The children of the Kenite, Moses’ brother-in-law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad; and they went and lived with the people. 
<span class="verse" id="JG1_17">17&#160;</span>Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they struck the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. The name of the city was called Hormah. 
<span class="verse" id="JG1_18">18&#160;</span>Also Judah took Gaza with its border, and Ashkelon with its border, and Ekron with its border. 
<span class="verse" id="JG1_19">19&#160;</span>Yahweh was with Judah, and drove out the inhabitants of the hill country; for he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron. 
<span class="verse" id="JG1_20">20&#160;</span>They gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had said, and he drove the three sons of Anak out of there. 
<span class="verse" id="JG1_21">21&#160;</span>The children of Benjamin didn’t drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem, but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG1_22">22&#160;</span>The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and Yahweh was with them. 
<span class="verse" id="JG1_23">23&#160;</span>The house of Joseph sent to spy out Bethel. (The name of the city before that was Luz.) 
<span class="verse" id="JG1_24">24&#160;</span>The watchers saw a man come out of the city, and they said to him, “Please show us the entrance into the city, and we will deal kindly with you.” 
<span class="verse" id="JG1_25">25&#160;</span>He showed them the entrance into the city, and they struck the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the man and all his family go. 
<span class="verse" id="JG1_26">26&#160;</span>The man went into the land of the Hittites, built a city, and called its name Luz, which is its name to this day. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG1_27">27&#160;</span>Manasseh didn’t drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shean and its towns, nor Taanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land. 
<span class="verse" id="JG1_28">28&#160;</span>When Israel had grown strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, and didn’t utterly drive them out. 
<span class="verse" id="JG1_29">29&#160;</span>Ephraim didn’t drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, but the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them. 
<span class="verse" id="JG1_30">30&#160;</span>Zebulun didn’t drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites lived among them, and became subject to forced labor. 
<span class="verse" id="JG1_31">31&#160;</span>Asher didn’t drive out the inhabitants of Acco, nor the inhabitants of Sidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob; 
<span class="verse" id="JG1_32">32&#160;</span>but the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, for they didn’t drive them out. 
<span class="verse" id="JG1_33">33&#160;</span>Naphtali didn’t drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth Anath; but he lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land. Nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and of Beth Anath became subject to forced labor. 
<span class="verse" id="JG1_34">34&#160;</span>The Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill country, for they would not allow them to come down to the valley; 
<span class="verse" id="JG1_35">35&#160;</span>but the Amorites would dwell in Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim. Yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became subject to forced labor. 
<span class="verse" id="JG1_36">36&#160;</span>The border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='JG2_0'>2</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG2_1">1&#160;</span>Yahweh’s angel came up from Gilgal to Bochim. He said, “I brought you out of Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore to give your fathers. I said, ‘I will never break my covenant with you. 
<span class="verse" id="JG2_2">2&#160;</span>You shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land. You shall break down their altars.’ But you have not listened to my voice. Why have you done this? 
<span class="verse" id="JG2_3">3&#160;</span>Therefore I also said, ‘I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be in your sides, and their gods will be a snare to you.’ ” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG2_4">4&#160;</span>When Yahweh’s angel spoke these words to all the children of Israel, the people lifted up their voice and wept. 
<span class="verse" id="JG2_5">5&#160;</span>They called the name of that place Bochim,<a href='#FN4' epub:type='noteref' class='noteref'>*</a> and they sacrificed there to Yahweh. 
<span class="verse" id="JG2_6">6&#160;</span>Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the children of Israel each went to his inheritance to possess the land. 
<span class="verse" id="JG2_7">7&#160;</span>The people served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of Yahweh that he had worked for Israel. 
<span class="verse" id="JG2_8">8&#160;</span>Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Yahweh, died, being one hundred ten years old. 
<span class="verse" id="JG2_9">9&#160;</span>They buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath Heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash. 
<span class="verse" id="JG2_10">10&#160;</span>After all that generation were gathered to their fathers, another generation arose after them who didn’t know Yahweh, nor the work which he had done for Israel. 
<span class="verse" id="JG2_11">11&#160;</span>The children of Israel did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and served the Baals. 
<span class="verse" id="JG2_12">12&#160;</span>They abandoned Yahweh, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the peoples who were around them, and bowed themselves down to them; and they provoked Yahweh to anger. 
<span class="verse" id="JG2_13">13&#160;</span>They abandoned Yahweh, and served Baal and the Ashtaroth. 
<span class="verse" id="JG2_14">14&#160;</span>Yahweh’s anger burned against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of raiders who plundered them. He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around, so that they could no longer stand before their enemies. 
<span class="verse" id="JG2_15">15&#160;</span>Wherever they went out, Yahweh’s hand was against them for evil, as Yahweh had spoken, and as Yahweh had sworn to them; and they were very distressed. 
<span class="verse" id="JG2_16">16&#160;</span>Yahweh raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand of those who plundered them. 
<span class="verse" id="JG2_17">17&#160;</span>Yet they didn’t listen to their judges; for they prostituted themselves to other gods, and bowed themselves down to them. They quickly turned away from the way in which their fathers walked, obeying Yahweh’s commandments. They didn’t do so. 
<span class="verse" id="JG2_18">18&#160;</span>When Yahweh raised up judges for them, then Yahweh was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for it grieved Yahweh because of their groaning by reason of those who oppressed them and troubled them. 
<span class="verse" id="JG2_19">19&#160;</span>But when the judge was dead, they turned back, and dealt more corruptly than their fathers in following other gods to serve them and to bow down to them. They didn’t cease what they were doing, or give up their stubborn ways. 
<span class="verse" id="JG2_20">20&#160;</span>Yahweh’s anger burned against Israel; and he said, “Because this nation transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and has not listened to my voice, 
<span class="verse" id="JG2_21">21&#160;</span>I also will no longer drive out any of the nations that Joshua left when he died from before them; 
<span class="verse" id="JG2_22">22&#160;</span>that by them I may test Israel, to see if they will keep Yahweh’s way to walk therein, as their fathers kept it, or not.” 
<span class="verse" id="JG2_23">23&#160;</span>So Yahweh left those nations, without driving them out hastily. He didn’t deliver them into Joshua’s hand.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='JG3_0'>3</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG3_1">1&#160;</span>Now these are the nations which Yahweh left, to test Israel by them, even as many as had not known all the wars of Canaan; 
<span class="verse" id="JG3_2">2&#160;</span>only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at least those who knew nothing of it before: 
<span class="verse" id="JG3_3">3&#160;</span>the five lords of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance of Hamath. 
<span class="verse" id="JG3_4">4&#160;</span>They were left to test Israel by them, to know whether they would listen to Yahweh’s commandments, which he commanded their fathers by Moses. 
<span class="verse" id="JG3_5">5&#160;</span>The children of Israel lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. 
<span class="verse" id="JG3_6">6&#160;</span>They took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons and served their gods. 
<span class="verse" id="JG3_7">7&#160;</span>The children of Israel did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and forgot Yahweh their God, and served the Baals and the Asheroth. 
<span class="verse" id="JG3_8">8&#160;</span>Therefore Yahweh’s anger burned against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia; and the children of Israel served Cushan Rishathaim eight years. 
<span class="verse" id="JG3_9">9&#160;</span>When the children of Israel cried to Yahweh, Yahweh raised up a savior to the children of Israel, who saved them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother. 
<span class="verse" id="JG3_10">10&#160;</span>Yahweh’s Spirit came on him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to war, and Yahweh delivered Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand. His hand prevailed against Cushan Rishathaim. 
<span class="verse" id="JG3_11">11&#160;</span>The land had rest forty years, then Othniel the son of Kenaz died. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG3_12">12&#160;</span>The children of Israel again did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and Yahweh strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight. 
<span class="verse" id="JG3_13">13&#160;</span>He gathered the children of Ammon and Amalek to himself; and he went and struck Israel, and they possessed the city of palm trees. 
<span class="verse" id="JG3_14">14&#160;</span>The children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years. 
<span class="verse" id="JG3_15">15&#160;</span>But when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh, Yahweh raised up a savior for them: Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a left-handed man. The children of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab. 
<span class="verse" id="JG3_16">16&#160;</span>Ehud made himself a sword which had two edges, a cubit<a href='#FN5' epub:type='noteref' class='noteref'>*</a> in length; and he wore it under his clothing on his right thigh. 
<span class="verse" id="JG3_17">17&#160;</span>He offered the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man. 
<span class="verse" id="JG3_18">18&#160;</span>When Ehud had finished offering the tribute, he sent away the people who carried the tribute. 
<span class="verse" id="JG3_19">19&#160;</span>But he himself turned back from the stone idols that were by Gilgal, and said, “I have a secret message for you, O king.” </div>
<div class='p'>The king said, “Keep silence!” All who stood by him left him. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG3_20">20&#160;</span>Ehud came to him; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room. Ehud said, “I have a message from God to you.” He arose out of his seat. 
<span class="verse" id="JG3_21">21&#160;</span>Ehud put out his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his body. 
<span class="verse" id="JG3_22">22&#160;</span>The handle also went in after the blade; and the fat closed on the blade, for he didn’t draw the sword out of his body; and it came out behind. 
<span class="verse" id="JG3_23">23&#160;</span>Then Ehud went out onto the porch, and shut the doors of the upper room on him, and locked them. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG3_24">24&#160;</span>After he had gone, his servants came and saw that the doors of the upper room were locked. They said, “Surely he is covering his feet<a href='#FN6' epub:type='noteref' class='noteref'>†</a> in the upper room.” 
<span class="verse" id="JG3_25">25&#160;</span>They waited until they were ashamed; and behold, he didn’t open the doors of the upper room. Therefore they took the key and opened them, and behold, their lord had fallen down dead on the floor. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG3_26">26&#160;</span>Ehud escaped while they waited, passed beyond the stone idols, and escaped to Seirah. 
<span class="verse" id="JG3_27">27&#160;</span>When he had come, he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he led them. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG3_28">28&#160;</span>He said to them, “Follow me; for Yahweh has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand.” They followed him, and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and didn’t allow any man to pass over. 
<span class="verse" id="JG3_29">29&#160;</span>They struck at that time about ten thousand men of Moab, every strong man and every man of valor. No man escaped. 
<span class="verse" id="JG3_30">30&#160;</span>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. Then the land had rest eighty years. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG3_31">31&#160;</span>After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who struck six hundred men of the Philistines with an ox goad. He also saved Israel.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='JG4_0'>4</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG4_1">1&#160;</span>The children of Israel again did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, when Ehud was dead. 
<span class="verse" id="JG4_2">2&#160;</span>Yahweh sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth of the Gentiles. 
<span class="verse" id="JG4_3">3&#160;</span>The children of Israel cried to Yahweh, for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and he mightily oppressed the children of Israel for twenty years. 
<span class="verse" id="JG4_4">4&#160;</span>Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, judged Israel at that time. 
<span class="verse" id="JG4_5">5&#160;</span>She lived under Deborah’s palm tree between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment. 
<span class="verse" id="JG4_6">6&#160;</span>She sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh Naphtali, and said to him, “Hasn’t Yahweh, the God of Israel, commanded, ‘Go and lead the way to Mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun? 
<span class="verse" id="JG4_7">7&#160;</span>I will draw to you, to the river Kishon, Sisera, the captain of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into your hand.’ ” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG4_8">8&#160;</span>Barak said to her, “If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG4_9">9&#160;</span>She said, “I will surely go with you. Nevertheless, the journey that you take won’t be for your honor; for Yahweh will sell Sisera into a woman’s hand.” Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG4_10">10&#160;</span>Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh. Ten thousand men followed him; and Deborah went up with him. 
<span class="verse" id="JG4_11">11&#160;</span>Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab, Moses’ brother-in-law, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim, which is by Kedesh. 
<span class="verse" id="JG4_12">12&#160;</span>They told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor. 
<span class="verse" id="JG4_13">13&#160;</span>Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles, to the river Kishon. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG4_14">14&#160;</span>Deborah said to Barak, “Go; for this is the day in which Yahweh has delivered Sisera into your hand. Hasn’t Yahweh gone out before you?” So Barak went down from Mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him. 
<span class="verse" id="JG4_15">15&#160;</span>Yahweh confused Sisera, all his chariots, and all his army, with the edge of the sword before Barak. Sisera abandoned his chariot and fled away on his feet. 
<span class="verse" id="JG4_16">16&#160;</span>But Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth of the Gentiles; and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword. There was not a man left. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG4_17">17&#160;</span>However Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. 
<span class="verse" id="JG4_18">18&#160;</span>Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, “Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; don’t be afraid.” He came in to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG4_19">19&#160;</span>He said to her, “Please give me a little water to drink; for I am thirsty.” </div>
<div class='p'>She opened a container of milk, and gave him a drink, and covered him. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG4_20">20&#160;</span>He said to her, “Stand in the door of the tent, and if any man comes and inquires of you, and says, ‘Is there any man here?’ you shall say, ‘No.’ ” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG4_21">21&#160;</span>Then Jael, Heber’s wife, took a tent peg, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and struck the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground, for he was in a deep sleep; so he fainted and died. 
<span class="verse" id="JG4_22">22&#160;</span>Behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, “Come, and I will show you the man whom you seek.” He came to her; and behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent peg was in his temples. 
<span class="verse" id="JG4_23">23&#160;</span>So God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel on that day. 
<span class="verse" id="JG4_24">24&#160;</span>The hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='JG5_0'>5</div>
<div class='p'>

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG7_4">4&#160;</span>Yahweh said to Gideon, “There are still too many people. Bring them down to the water, and I will test them for you there.

<span class="verse" id="JG7_5">5&#160;</span>So he brought down the people to the water; and Yahweh said to Gideon, “Everyone who laps of the water with his tongue, like a dog laps, you shall set him by himself; likewise everyone who bows down on his knees to drink.” 
<span class="verse" id="JG7_6">6&#160;</span>The number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men; but all the rest of the people bowed down on their knees to drink water.

<span class="verse" id="JG7_8">8&#160;</span>So the people took food in their hand, and their trumpets; and he sent all the rest of the men of Israel to their own tents, but retained the three hundred men; and the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley.

<span class="verse" id="JG7_13">13&#160;</span>When Gideon had come, behold, there was a man telling a dream to his fellow.

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG7_14">14&#160;</span>His fellow answered, “This is nothing other than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel. God has delivered Midian into his hand, with all the army.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG7_15">15&#160;</span>It was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation, that he worshiped. Then he returned into the camp of Israel and said, “Arise, for Yahweh has delivered the army of Midian into your hand!” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG7_16">16&#160;</span>He divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put into the hands of all them trumpets and empty pitchers, with torches within the pitchers. </div>

<span class="verse" id="JG7_22">22&#160;</span>They blew the three hundred trumpets, and Yahweh set every man’s sword against his fellow and against all the army; and the army fled as far as Beth Shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel Meholah, by Tabbath. 
<span class="verse" id="JG7_23">23&#160;</span>The men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali, out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued Midian.

<span class="verse" id="JG11_18">18&#160;</span>Then they went through the wilderness, and went around the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and they encamped on the other side of the Arnon; but they didn’t come within the border of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab. 
<span class="verse" id="JG11_19">19&#160;</span>Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, ‘Please let us pass through your land to my place.’

<span class="verse" id="JG11_21">21&#160;</span>Yahweh, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they struck them. So Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.

<span class="verse" id="JG11_23">23&#160;</span>So now Yahweh, the God of Israel, has dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and should you possess them? 
<span class="verse" id="JG11_24">24&#160;</span>Won’t you possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whoever Yahweh our God has dispossessed from before us, them will we possess. 
<span class="verse" id="JG11_25">25&#160;</span>Now are you anything better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them? 
<span class="verse" id="JG11_26">26&#160;</span>Israel lived in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are along the side of the Arnon for three hundred years! Why didn’t you recover them within that time?

<span class="verse" id="JG11_32">32&#160;</span>So Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them; and Yahweh delivered them into his hand.

<span class="verse" id="JG16_12">12&#160;</span>So Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them, then said to him, “The Philistines are on you, Samson!” The ambush was waiting in the inner room. He broke them off his arms like a thread. </div>

<span class="verse" id="JG16_13">13&#160;</span>Delilah said to Samson, “Until now, you have mocked me and told me lies. Tell me with what you might be bound.” </div>

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG16_14">14&#160;</span>She fastened it with the pin, and said to him, “The Philistines are on you, Samson!” He awakened out of his sleep, and plucked away the pin of the beam and the fabric. </div>

<span class="verse" id="JG16_15">15&#160;</span>She said to him, “How can you say, ‘I love you,’ when your heart is not with me? You have mocked me these three times, and have not told me where your great strength lies.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG16_16">16&#160;</span>When she pressed him daily with her words and urged him, his soul was troubled to death. 
<span class="verse" id="JG16_17">17&#160;</span>He told her all his heart and said to her, “No razor has ever come on my head; for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother’s womb. If I am shaved, then my strength will go from me and I will become weak, and be like any other man.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG16_18">18&#160;</span>When Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, “Come up this once, for he has told me all his heart.” Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her and brought the money in their hand. 
<span class="verse" id="JG16_19">19&#160;</span>She made him sleep on her knees; and she called for a man and shaved off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.

<div class='p'>He awoke out of his sleep, and said, “I will go out as at other times, and shake myself free.” But he didn’t know that Yahweh had departed from him. 
<span class="verse" id="JG16_21">21&#160;</span>The Philistines laid hold on him and put out his eyes; and they brought him down to Gaza and bound him with fetters of bronze; and he ground at the mill in the prison. 
<span class="verse" id="JG16_22">22&#160;</span>However, the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaved. </div>

<span class="verse" id="JG16_23">23&#160;</span>The lords of the Philistines gathered together to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice; for they said, “Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.” 
<span class="verse" id="JG16_24">24&#160;</span>When the people saw him, they praised their god; for they said, “Our god has delivered our enemy and the destroyer of our country, who has slain many of us, into our hand.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG16_25">25&#160;</span>When their hearts were merry, they said, “Call for Samson, that he may entertain us.” They called for Samson out of the prison; and he performed before them. They set him between the pillars; 
<span class="verse" id="JG16_26">26&#160;</span>and Samson said to the boy who held him by the hand, “Allow me to feel the pillars on which the house rests, that I may lean on them.” 
<span class="verse" id="JG16_27">27&#160;</span>Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were on the roof about three thousand men and women, who saw while Samson performed. 
<span class="verse" id="JG16_28">28&#160;</span>Samson called to Yahweh, and said, “Lord Yahweh, remember me, please, and strengthen me, please, only this once, God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.” 
<span class="verse" id="JG16_29">29&#160;</span>Samson took hold of the two middle pillars on which the house rested and leaned on them, the one with his right hand and the other with his left. 
<span class="verse" id="JG16_30">30&#160;</span>Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines!” He bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell on the lords, and on all the people who were in it. So the dead that he killed at his death were more than those who he killed in his life. </div>

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG17_4">4&#160;</span>When he restored the money to his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and gave them to a silversmith, who made a carved image and a molten image out of it. It was in the house of Micah. </div>

Now therefore consider what you have to do.” 
<span class="verse" id="JG18_15">15&#160;</span>They went over there and came to the house of the young Levite man, even to the house of Micah, and asked him how he was doing.

<span class="verse" id="JG18_18">18&#160;</span>When these went into Micah’s house, and took the engraved image, the ephod, the teraphim, and the molten image, the priest said to them, “What are you doing?” </div>

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG18_20">20&#160;</span>The priest’s heart was glad, and he took the ephod, the teraphim, and the engraved image, and went with the people.

<span class="verse" id="JG18_22">22&#160;</span>When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men who were in the houses near Micah’s house gathered together and overtook the children of Dan.

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG18_25">25&#160;</span>The children of Dan said to him, “Don’t let your voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall on you, and you lose your life, with the lives of your household.” </div>

<span class="verse" id="JG18_27">27&#160;</span>They took that which Micah had made, and the priest whom he had, and came to Laish, to a people quiet and unsuspecting, and struck them with the edge of the sword; then they burned the city with fire. 
<span class="verse" id="JG18_28">28&#160;</span>There was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with anyone else; and it was in the valley that lies by Beth Rehob. They built the city and lived in it. 
<span class="verse" id="JG18_29">29&#160;</span>They called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel; however the name of the city used to be Laish. 
<span class="verse" id="JG18_30">30&#160;</span>The children of Dan set up for themselves the engraved image; and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land.

<span class="verse" id="JG19_1">1&#160;</span>In those days, when there was no king in Israel, there was a certain Levite living on the farther side of the hill country of Ephraim, who took for himself a concubine out of Bethlehem Judah. 
<span class="verse" id="JG19_2">2&#160;</span>His concubine played the prostitute against him, and went away from him to her father’s house to Bethlehem Judah, and was there for four months. 
<span class="verse" id="JG19_3">3&#160;</span>Her husband arose and went after her to speak kindly to her, to bring her again, having his servant with him and a couple of donkeys. She brought him into her father’s house; and when the father of the young lady saw him, he rejoiced to meet him. 
<span class="verse" id="JG19_4">4&#160;</span>His father-in-law, the young lady’s father, kept him there; and he stayed with him three days. So they ate and drank, and stayed there. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG19_5">5&#160;</span>On the fourth day, they got up early in the morning, and he rose up to depart. The young lady’s father said to his son-in-law, “Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward you shall go your way.” 
<span class="verse" id="JG19_6">6&#160;</span>So they sat down, ate, and drank, both of them together. Then the young lady’s father said to the man, “Please be pleased to stay all night, and let your heart be merry.” 
<span class="verse" id="JG19_7">7&#160;</span>The man rose up to depart; but his father-in-law urged him, and he stayed there again. 
<span class="verse" id="JG19_8">8&#160;</span>He arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the young lady’s father said, “Please strengthen your heart and stay until the day declines;” and they both ate. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG19_9">9&#160;</span>When the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the young lady’s father, said to him, “Behold, now the day draws toward evening, please stay all night.

<span class="verse" id="JG19_10">10&#160;</span>But the man wouldn’t stay that night, but he rose up and went near Jebus (also called Jerusalem). With him were a couple of saddled donkeys. His concubine also was with him. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG19_11">11&#160;</span>When they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said to his master, “Please come and let’s enter into this city of the Jebusites, and stay in it.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG19_12">12&#160;</span>His master said to him, “We won’t enter into the city of a foreigner that is not of the children of Israel; but we will pass over to Gibeah.” 
<span class="verse" id="JG19_13">13&#160;</span>He said to his servant, “Come and let’s draw near to one of these places; and we will lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah.” 
<span class="verse" id="JG19_14">14&#160;</span>So they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down on them near Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin. 
<span class="verse" id="JG19_15">15&#160;</span>They went over there, to go in to stay in Gibeah. He went in, and sat down in the street of the city; for there was no one who took them into his house to stay. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG19_16">16&#160;</span>Behold, an old man came from his work out of the field at evening. Now the man was from the hill country of Ephraim, and he lived in Gibeah; but the men of the place were Benjamites.

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG19_18">18&#160;</span>He said to him, “We are passing from Bethlehem Judah to the farther side of the hill country of Ephraim. I am from there, and I went to Bethlehem Judah. I am going to Yahweh’s house; and there is no one who has taken me into his house. 
<span class="verse" id="JG19_19">19&#160;</span>Yet there is both straw and feed for our donkeys; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for your servant, and for the young man who is with your servants. There is no lack of anything.” </div>

<span class="verse" id="JG19_22">22&#160;</span>As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain wicked fellows, surrounded the house, beating at the door; and they spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, “Bring out the man who came into your house, that we can have sex with him!” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG19_23">23&#160;</span>The man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said to them, “No, my brothers, please don’t act so wickedly; since this man has come into my house, don’t do this folly.

<span class="verse" id="JG19_25">25&#160;</span>But the men wouldn’t listen to him; so the man grabbed his concubine, and brought her out to them; and they had sex with her, and abused her all night until the morning. When the day began to dawn, they let her go. 
<span class="verse" id="JG19_26">26&#160;</span>Then the woman came in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man’s house where her lord was, until it was light. 
<span class="verse" id="JG19_27">27&#160;</span>Her lord rose up in the morning and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way; and behold, the woman his concubine had fallen down at the door of the house, with her hands on the threshold. </div>

<span class="verse" id="JG20_19">19&#160;</span>The children of Israel rose up in the morning and encamped against Gibeah. 
<span class="verse" id="JG20_20">20&#160;</span>The men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gibeah. 
<span class="verse" id="JG20_21">21&#160;</span>The children of Benjamin came out of Gibeah, and on that day destroyed twenty-two thousand of the Israelite men down to the ground. 
<span class="verse" id="JG20_22">22&#160;</span>The people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves, and set the battle again in array in the place where they set themselves in array the first day. 
<span class="verse" id="JG20_23">23&#160;</span>The children of Israel went up and wept before Yahweh until evening; and they asked of Yahweh, saying, “Shall I again draw near to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother?” </div>
<div class='p'>Yahweh said, “Go up against him.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG20_24">24&#160;</span>The children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day. 
<span class="verse" id="JG20_25">25&#160;</span>Benjamin went out against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men. All these drew the sword. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG20_26">26&#160;</span>Then all the children of Israel and all the people went up, and came to Bethel, and wept, and sat there before Yahweh, and fasted that day until evening; then they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Yahweh. 
<span class="verse" id="JG20_27">27&#160;</span>The children of Israel asked Yahweh (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days, 
<span class="verse" id="JG20_28">28&#160;</span>and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days), saying, “Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease?” </div>
<div class='p'>Yahweh said, “Go up; for tomorrow I will deliver him into your hand.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG20_29">29&#160;</span>Israel set ambushes all around Gibeah. 
<span class="verse" id="JG20_30">30&#160;</span>The children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and set themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times. 
<span class="verse" id="JG20_31">31&#160;</span>The children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to strike and kill of the people as at other times, in the highways, of which one goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah, in the field, about thirty men of Israel. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG20_32">32&#160;</span>The children of Benjamin said, “They are struck down before us, as at the first.” But the children of Israel said, “Let’s flee, and draw them away from the city to the highways.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG20_33">33&#160;</span>All the men of Israel rose up out of their place and set themselves in array at Baal Tamar. Then the ambushers of Israel broke out of their place, even out of Maareh Geba. 
<span class="verse" id="JG20_34">34&#160;</span>Ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel came over against Gibeah, and the battle was severe; but they didn’t know that disaster was close to them. 
<span class="verse" id="JG20_35">35&#160;</span>Yahweh struck Benjamin before Israel; and the children of Israel destroyed of Benjamin that day twenty-five thousand one hundred men. All these drew the sword. 
<span class="verse" id="JG20_36">36&#160;</span>So the children of Benjamin saw that they were struck, for the men of Israel yielded to Benjamin because they trusted the ambushers whom they had set against Gibeah. 
<span class="verse" id="JG20_37">37&#160;</span>The ambushers hurried, and rushed on Gibeah; then the ambushers spread out, and struck all the city with the edge of the sword. 
<span class="verse" id="JG20_38">38&#160;</span>Now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the ambushers was that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city. 
<span class="verse" id="JG20_39">39&#160;</span>The men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began to strike and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons; for they said, “Surely they are struck down before us, as in the first battle.” 
<span class="verse" id="JG20_40">40&#160;</span>But when the cloud began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them; and behold, the whole city went up in smoke to the sky. 
<span class="verse" id="JG20_41">41&#160;</span>The men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed; for they saw that disaster had come on them. 
<span class="verse" id="JG20_42">42&#160;</span>Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness, but the battle followed hard after them; and those who came out of the cities destroyed them in the middle of it. 
<span class="verse" id="JG20_43">43&#160;</span>They surrounded the Benjamites, chased them, and trod them down at their resting place, as far as near Gibeah toward the sunrise. 
<span class="verse" id="JG20_44">44&#160;</span>Eighteen thousand men of Benjamin fell; all these were men of valor. 
<span class="verse" id="JG20_45">45&#160;</span>They turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon. They gleaned five thousand men of them in the highways, and followed hard after them to Gidom, and struck two thousand men of them. 
<span class="verse" id="JG20_46">46&#160;</span>So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty-five thousand men who drew the sword. All these were men of valor. 
<span class="verse" id="JG20_47">47&#160;</span>But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and stayed in the rock of Rimmon four months. 
<span class="verse" id="JG20_48">48&#160;</span>The men of Israel turned again on the children of Benjamin, and struck them with the edge of the sword—including the entire city, the livestock, and all that they found. Moreover they set all the cities which they found on fire.  </div>

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG21_1">1&#160;</span>Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying, “None of us will give his daughter to Benjamin as a wife.” 
<span class="verse" id="JG21_2">2&#160;</span>The people came to Bethel and sat there until evening before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept severely. 
<span class="verse" id="JG21_3">3&#160;</span>They said, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, why has this happened in Israel, that there should be one tribe lacking in Israel today?” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG21_4">4&#160;</span>On the next day, the people rose early and built an altar there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. 
<span class="verse" id="JG21_5">5&#160;</span>The children of Israel said, “Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who didn’t come up in the assembly to Yahweh?” For they had made a great oath concerning him who didn’t come up to Yahweh to Mizpah, saying, “He shall surely be put to death.” 
<span class="verse" id="JG21_6">6&#160;</span>The children of Israel grieved for Benjamin their brother, and said, “There is one tribe cut off from Israel today. 
<span class="verse" id="JG21_7">7&#160;</span>How shall we provide wives for those who remain, since we have sworn by Yahweh that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?” 
<span class="verse" id="JG21_8">8&#160;</span>They said, “What one is there of the tribes of Israel who didn’t come up to Yahweh to Mizpah?” Behold, no one came from Jabesh Gilead to the camp to the assembly. 
<span class="verse" id="JG21_9">9&#160;</span>For when the people were counted, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead there. 
<span class="verse" id="JG21_10">10&#160;</span>The congregation sent twelve thousand of the most valiant men there, and commanded them, saying, “Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones. 
<span class="verse" id="JG21_11">11&#160;</span>This is the thing that you shall do: you shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman who has lain with a man.” 
<span class="verse" id="JG21_12">12&#160;</span>They found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins who had not known man by lying with him; and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG21_13">13&#160;</span>The whole congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin who were in the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace to them. 
<span class="verse" id="JG21_14">14&#160;</span>Benjamin returned at that time; and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh Gilead. There still weren’t enough for them. 
<span class="verse" id="JG21_15">15&#160;</span>The people grieved for Benjamin, because Yahweh had made a breach in the tribes of Israel. 
<span class="verse" id="JG21_16">16&#160;</span>Then the elders of the congregation said, “How shall we provide wives for those who remain, since the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?” 
<span class="verse" id="JG21_17">17&#160;</span>They said, “There must be an inheritance for those who are escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe not be blotted out from Israel. 
<span class="verse" id="JG21_18">18&#160;</span>However, we may not give them wives of our daughters, for the children of Israel had sworn, saying, ‘Cursed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin.’ ” 
<span class="verse" id="JG21_19">19&#160;</span>They said, “Behold, there is a feast of Yahweh from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.” 
<span class="verse" id="JG21_20">20&#160;</span>They commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, “Go and lie in wait in the vineyards, 
<span class="verse" id="JG21_21">21&#160;</span>and see, and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come out of the vineyards, and each man catch his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin. 
<span class="verse" id="JG21_22">22&#160;</span>It shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, that we will say to them, ‘Grant them graciously to us, because we didn’t take for each man his wife in battle, neither did you give them to them; otherwise you would now be guilty.’ ” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="JG21_23">23&#160;</span>The children of Benjamin did so, and took wives for themselves according to their number, of those who danced, whom they carried off. They went and returned to their inheritance, built the cities, and lived in them. 
<span class="verse" id="JG21_24">24&#160;</span>The children of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they each went out from there to his own inheritance. 
<span class="verse" id="JG21_25">25&#160;</span>In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did that which was right in his own eyes. </div><div class="footnote">
