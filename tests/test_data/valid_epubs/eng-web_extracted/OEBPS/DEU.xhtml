<div class='chapterlabel' id='DT1_0'>1</div>
<div class='p'>

<span class="verse" id="DT1_1">1&#160;</span>These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah opposite Suf, between Paran, Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_2">2&#160;</span>It is eleven days’ journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh Barnea. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_3">3&#160;</span>In the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, Moses spoke to the children of Israel according to all that Yahweh<a href='#FN1' epub:type='noteref' class='noteref'>*</a> had given him in commandment to them, 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_4">4&#160;</span>after he had struck Sihon the king of the Amorites who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan who lived in Ashtaroth, at Edrei. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_5">5&#160;</span>Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses began to declare this law, saying, 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_6">6&#160;</span>“Yahweh our God<a href='#FN2' epub:type='noteref' class='noteref'>†</a> spoke to us in Horeb, saying, ‘You have lived long enough at this mountain. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_7">7&#160;</span>Turn, and take your journey, and go to the hill country of the Amorites and to all the places near there: in the Arabah, in the hill country, in the lowland, in the South, by the seashore, in the land of the Canaanites, and in Lebanon as far as the great river, the river Euphrates. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_8">8&#160;</span>Behold,<a href='#FN3' epub:type='noteref' class='noteref'>‡</a> I have set the land before you. Go in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers—to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob—to give to them and to their offspring<a href='#FN4' epub:type='noteref' class='noteref'>§</a> after them.’ ” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT1_9">9&#160;</span>I spoke to you at that time, saying, “I am not able to bear you myself alone. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_10">10&#160;</span>Yahweh your God has multiplied you, and behold, you are today as the stars of the sky for multitude. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_11">11&#160;</span>May Yahweh, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as you are and bless you, as he has promised you! 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_12">12&#160;</span>How can I myself alone bear your problems, your burdens, and your strife? 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_13">13&#160;</span>Take wise men of understanding who are respected among your tribes, and I will make them heads over you.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT1_14">14&#160;</span>You answered me, and said, “The thing which you have spoken is good to do.” 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_15">15&#160;</span>So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and respected men, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, captains of hundreds, captains of fifties, captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_16">16&#160;</span>I commanded your judges at that time, saying, “Hear cases between your brothers and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the foreigner who is living with him. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_17">17&#160;</span>You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small and the great alike. You shall not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgment is God’s. The case that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.” 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_18">18&#160;</span>I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_19">19&#160;</span>We traveled from Horeb and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw, by the way to the hill country of the Amorites, as Yahweh our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh Barnea. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_20">20&#160;</span>I said to you, “You have come to the hill country of the Amorites, which Yahweh our God gives to us. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_21">21&#160;</span>Behold, Yahweh your God has set the land before you. Go up, take possession, as Yahweh the God of your fathers has spoken to you. Don’t be afraid, neither be dismayed.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT1_22">22&#160;</span>You came near to me, everyone of you, and said, “Let’s send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring back to us word of the way by which we must go up, and the cities to which we shall come.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT1_23">23&#160;</span>The thing pleased me well. I took twelve of your men, one man for every tribe. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_24">24&#160;</span>They turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_25">25&#160;</span>They took some of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down to us, and brought us word again, and said, “It is a good land which Yahweh our God gives to us.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT1_26">26&#160;</span>Yet you wouldn’t go up, but rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your God. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_27">27&#160;</span>You murmured in your tents, and said, “Because Yahweh hated us, he has brought us out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_28">28&#160;</span>Where are we going up? Our brothers have made our heart melt, saying, ‘The people are greater and taller than we. The cities are great and fortified up to the sky. Moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there!’ ” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT1_29">29&#160;</span>Then I said to you, “Don’t be terrified. Don’t be afraid of them. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_30">30&#160;</span>Yahweh your God, who goes before you, he will fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes, 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_31">31&#160;</span>and in the wilderness where you have seen how that Yahweh your God carried you, as a man carries his son, in all the way that you went, until you came to this place.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT1_32">32&#160;</span>Yet in this thing you didn’t believe Yahweh your God, 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_33">33&#160;</span>who went before you on the way, to seek out a place for you to pitch your tents in: in fire by night, to show you by what way you should go, and in the cloud by day. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_34">34&#160;</span>Yahweh heard the voice of your words and was angry, and swore, saying, 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_35">35&#160;</span>“Surely not one of these men of this evil generation shall see the good land which I swore to give to your fathers, 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_36">36&#160;</span>except Caleb the son of Jephunneh. He shall see it. I will give the land that he has trodden on to him and to his children, because he has wholly followed Yahweh.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT1_37">37&#160;</span>Also Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, saying, “You also shall not go in there. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_38">38&#160;</span>Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, shall go in there. Encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_39">39&#160;</span>Moreover your little ones, whom you said would be captured or killed, your children, who today have no knowledge of good or evil, shall go in there. I will give it to them, and they shall possess it. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_40">40&#160;</span>But as for you, turn, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT1_41">41&#160;</span>Then you answered and said to me, “We have sinned against Yahweh. We will go up and fight, according to all that Yahweh our God commanded us.” Every man of you put on his weapons of war, and presumed to go up into the hill country. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT1_42">42&#160;</span>Yahweh said to me, “Tell them, ‘Don’t go up and don’t fight; for I am not among you, lest you be struck before your enemies.’ ” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT1_43">43&#160;</span>So I spoke to you, and you didn’t listen; but you rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill country. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_44">44&#160;</span>The Amorites, who lived in that hill country, came out against you and chased you as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even to Hormah. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_45">45&#160;</span>You returned and wept before Yahweh, but Yahweh didn’t listen to your voice, nor turn his ear to you. 
<span class="verse" id="DT1_46">46&#160;</span>So you stayed in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you remained.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='DT2_0'>2</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT2_1">1&#160;</span>Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea, as Yahweh spoke to me; and we encircled Mount Seir many days. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT2_2">2&#160;</span>Yahweh spoke to me, saying, 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_3">3&#160;</span>“You have encircled this mountain long enough. Turn northward. 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_4">4&#160;</span>Command the people, saying, ‘You are to pass through the border of your brothers, the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. Therefore be careful. 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_5">5&#160;</span>Don’t contend with them; for I will not give you any of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau for a possession. 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_6">6&#160;</span>You shall purchase food from them for money, that you may eat. You shall also buy water from them for money, that you may drink.’ ” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT2_7">7&#160;</span>For Yahweh your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He has known your walking through this great wilderness. These forty years, Yahweh your God has been with you. You have lacked nothing. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT2_8">8&#160;</span>So we passed by from our brothers, the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion Geber. We turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT2_9">9&#160;</span>Yahweh said to me, “Don’t bother Moab, neither contend with them in battle; for I will not give you any of his land for a possession, because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT2_10">10&#160;</span>(The Emim lived there before, a great and numerous people, and tall as the Anakim. 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_11">11&#160;</span>These also are considered to be Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim. 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_12">12&#160;</span>The Horites also lived in Seir in the past, but the children of Esau succeeded them. They destroyed them from before them, and lived in their place, as Israel did to the land of his possession, which Yahweh gave to them.) </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT2_13">13&#160;</span>“Now rise up and cross over the brook Zered.” We went over the brook Zered. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT2_14">14&#160;</span>The days in which we came from Kadesh Barnea until we had come over the brook Zered were thirty-eight years, until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from the middle of the camp, as Yahweh swore to them. 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_15">15&#160;</span>Moreover Yahweh’s hand was against them, to destroy them from the middle of the camp, until they were consumed. 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_16">16&#160;</span>So, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people, 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_17">17&#160;</span>Yahweh spoke to me, saying, 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_18">18&#160;</span>“You are to pass over Ar, the border of Moab, today. 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_19">19&#160;</span>When you come near the border of the children of Ammon, don’t bother them, nor contend with them; for I will not give you any of the land of the children of Ammon for a possession, because I have given it to the children of Lot for a possession.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT2_20">20&#160;</span>(That also is considered a land of Rephaim. Rephaim lived there in the past, but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim, 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_21">21&#160;</span>a great people, many, and tall, as the Anakim; but Yahweh destroyed them from before Israel, and they succeeded them, and lived in their place, 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_22">22&#160;</span>as he did for the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them; and they succeeded them, and lived in their place even to this day. 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_23">23&#160;</span>Then the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza: the Caphtorim, who came out of Caphtor, destroyed them and lived in their place.) </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT2_24">24&#160;</span>“Rise up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of the Arnon. Behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle. 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_25">25&#160;</span>Today I will begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole sky, who shall hear the report of you, and shall tremble and be in anguish because of you.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT2_26">26&#160;</span>I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_27">27&#160;</span>“Let me pass through your land. I will go along by the highway. I will turn neither to the right hand nor to the left. 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_28">28&#160;</span>You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink. Just let me pass through on my feet, 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_29">29&#160;</span>as the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites who dwell in Ar, did to me, until I pass over the Jordan into the land which Yahweh our God gives us.” 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_30">30&#160;</span>But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him, for Yahweh your God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into your hand, as it is today. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT2_31">31&#160;</span>Yahweh said to me, “Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before you. Begin to possess, that you may inherit his land.” 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_32">32&#160;</span>Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Jahaz. 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_33">33&#160;</span>Yahweh our God delivered him up before us; and we struck him, his sons, and all his people. 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_34">34&#160;</span>We took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones. We left no one remaining. 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_35">35&#160;</span>Only the livestock we took for plunder for ourselves, with the plunder of the cities which we had taken. 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_36">36&#160;</span>From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the valley, even to Gilead, there was not a city too high for us. Yahweh our God delivered up all before us. 
<span class="verse" id="DT2_37">37&#160;</span>Only to the land of the children of Ammon you didn’t come near: all the banks of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill country, and wherever Yahweh our God forbade us.  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='DT3_0'>3</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT3_1">1&#160;</span>Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan. Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. 
<span class="verse" id="DT3_2">2&#160;</span>Yahweh said to me, “Don’t fear him; for I have delivered him, with all his people and his land, into your hand. You shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT3_3">3&#160;</span>So Yahweh our God also delivered into our hand Og, the king of Bashan, and all his people. We struck him until no one was left to him remaining. 
<span class="verse" id="DT3_4">4&#160;</span>We took all his cities at that time. There was not a city which we didn’t take from them: sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
<span class="verse" id="DT3_5">5&#160;</span>All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, in addition to a great many villages without walls. 
<span class="verse" id="DT3_6">6&#160;</span>We utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones. 
<span class="verse" id="DT3_7">7&#160;</span>But all the livestock, and the plunder of the cities, we took for plunder for ourselves. 
<span class="verse" id="DT3_8">8&#160;</span>We took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon. 
<span class="verse" id="DT3_9">9&#160;</span>(The Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir.) 
<span class="verse" id="DT3_10">10&#160;</span>We took all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
<span class="verse" id="DT3_11">11&#160;</span>(For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim. Behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron. Isn’t it in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? Nine cubits<a href='#FN5' epub:type='noteref' class='noteref'>*</a> was its length, and four cubits its width, after the cubit of a man.) 
<span class="verse" id="DT3_12">12&#160;</span>This land we took in possession at that time: from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead with its cities, I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites; 
<span class="verse" id="DT3_13">13&#160;</span>and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh—all the region of Argob, even all Bashan. (The same is called the land of Rephaim. 
<span class="verse" id="DT3_14">14&#160;</span>Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth Jair, to this day.) 
<span class="verse" id="DT3_15">15&#160;</span>I gave Gilead to Machir. 
<span class="verse" id="DT3_16">16&#160;</span>To the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the valley of the Arnon, the middle of the valley, and its border, even to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon; 
<span class="verse" id="DT3_17">17&#160;</span>the Arabah also, and the Jordan and its border, from Chinnereth even to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT3_18">18&#160;</span>I commanded you at that time, saying, “Yahweh your God has given you this land to possess it. All of you men of valor shall pass over armed before your brothers, the children of Israel. 
<span class="verse" id="DT3_19">19&#160;</span>But your wives, and your little ones, and your livestock, (I know that you have much livestock), shall live in your cities which I have given you, 
<span class="verse" id="DT3_20">20&#160;</span>until Yahweh gives rest to your brothers, as to you, and they also possess the land which Yahweh your God gives them beyond the Jordan. Then you shall each return to his own possession, which I have given you.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT3_21">21&#160;</span>I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, “Your eyes have seen all that Yahweh your God has done to these two kings. So shall Yahweh do to all the kingdoms where you go over. 
<span class="verse" id="DT3_22">22&#160;</span>You shall not fear them; for Yahweh your God himself fights for you.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT3_23">23&#160;</span>I begged Yahweh at that time, saying, 
<span class="verse" id="DT3_24">24&#160;</span>“Lord<a href='#FN6' epub:type='noteref' class='noteref'>†</a> Yahweh, you have begun to show your servant your greatness, and your strong hand. For what god is there in heaven or in earth that can do works like yours, and mighty acts like yours? 
<span class="verse" id="DT3_25">25&#160;</span>Please let me go over and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that fine mountain, and Lebanon.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT3_26">26&#160;</span>But Yahweh was angry with me because of you, and didn’t listen to me. Yahweh said to me, “That is enough! Speak no more to me of this matter.

<span class="verse" id="DT4_10">10&#160;</span>the day that you stood before Yahweh your God in Horeb, when Yahweh said to me, “Assemble the people to me, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they live on the earth, and that they may teach their children.” 
<span class="verse" id="DT4_11">11&#160;</span>You came near and stood under the mountain. The mountain burned with fire to the heart of the sky, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness. 
<span class="verse" id="DT4_12">12&#160;</span>Yahweh spoke to you out of the middle of the fire: you heard the voice of words, but you saw no form; you only heard a voice. 
<span class="verse" id="DT4_13">13&#160;</span>He declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even the ten commandments. He wrote them on two stone tablets. 
<span class="verse" id="DT4_14">14&#160;</span>Yahweh commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances, that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it. 
<span class="verse" id="DT4_15">15&#160;</span>Be very careful, for you saw no kind of form on the day that Yahweh spoke to you in Horeb out of the middle of the fire, 
<span class="verse" id="DT4_16">16&#160;</span>lest you corrupt yourselves, and make yourself a carved image in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female, 
<span class="verse" id="DT4_17">17&#160;</span>the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the sky, 
<span class="verse" id="DT4_18">18&#160;</span>the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth; 
<span class="verse" id="DT4_19">19&#160;</span>and lest you lift up your eyes to the sky, and when you see the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the army of the sky, you are drawn away and worship them, and serve them, which Yahweh your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole sky. 
<span class="verse" id="DT4_20">20&#160;</span>But Yahweh has taken you, and brought you out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance, as it is today. 
<span class="verse" id="DT4_21">21&#160;</span>Furthermore Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, and swore that I should not go over the Jordan, and that I should not go in to that good land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance; 
<span class="verse" id="DT4_22">22&#160;</span>but I must die in this land. I must not go over the Jordan, but you shall go over and possess that good land. 
<span class="verse" id="DT4_23">23&#160;</span>Be careful, lest you forget the covenant of Yahweh your God, which he made with you, and make yourselves a carved image in the form of anything which Yahweh your God has forbidden you. 
<span class="verse" id="DT4_24">24&#160;</span>For Yahweh your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God. 
<span class="verse" id="DT4_25">25&#160;</span>When you father children and children’s children, and you have been long in the land, and then corrupt yourselves, and make a carved image in the form of anything, and do that which is evil in Yahweh your God’s sight to provoke him to anger, 
<span class="verse" id="DT4_26">26&#160;</span>I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that you will soon utterly perish from off the land which you go over the Jordan to possess it. You will not prolong your days on it, but will utterly be destroyed.

<span class="verse" id="DT4_29">29&#160;</span>But from there you shall seek Yahweh your God, and you will find him when you search after him with all your heart and with all your soul. 
<span class="verse" id="DT4_30">30&#160;</span>When you are in oppression, and all these things have come on you, in the latter days you shall return to Yahweh your God and listen to his voice. 
<span class="verse" id="DT4_31">31&#160;</span>For Yahweh your God is a merciful God. He will not fail you nor destroy you, nor forget the covenant of your fathers which he swore to them.

<span class="verse" id="DT4_33">33&#160;</span>Did a people ever hear the voice of God speaking out of the middle of the fire, as you have heard, and live? 
<span class="verse" id="DT4_34">34&#160;</span>Or has God tried to go and take a nation for himself from among another nation, by trials, by signs, by wonders, by war, by a mighty hand, by an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that Yahweh your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes? 
<span class="verse" id="DT4_35">35&#160;</span>It was shown to you so that you might know that Yahweh is God. There is no one else besides him. 
<span class="verse" id="DT4_36">36&#160;</span>Out of heaven he made you to hear his voice, that he might instruct you. On earth he made you to see his great fire; and you heard his words out of the middle of the fire. 
<span class="verse" id="DT4_37">37&#160;</span>Because he loved your fathers, therefore he chose their offspring after them, and brought you out with his presence, with his great power, out of Egypt; 
<span class="verse" id="DT4_38">38&#160;</span>to drive out nations from before you greater and mightier than you, to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance, as it is today. 
<span class="verse" id="DT4_39">39&#160;</span>Know therefore today, and take it to heart, that Yahweh himself is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath. There is no one else.

<span class="verse" id="DT9_1">1&#160;</span>Hear, Israel! You are to pass over the Jordan today, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourself, cities great and fortified up to the sky,

<span class="verse" id="DT9_3">3&#160;</span>Know therefore today that Yahweh your God is he who goes over before you as a devouring fire. He will destroy them and he will bring them down before you. So you shall drive them out and make them perish quickly, as Yahweh has spoken to you. </div>

<span class="verse" id="DT9_4">4&#160;</span>Don’t say in your heart, after Yahweh your God has thrust them out from before you, “For my righteousness Yahweh has brought me in to possess this land;” because Yahweh drives them out before you because of the wickedness of these nations.

<span class="verse" id="DT9_6">6&#160;</span>Know therefore that Yahweh your God doesn’t give you this good land to possess for your righteousness, for you are a stiff-necked people. 
<span class="verse" id="DT9_7">7&#160;</span>Remember, and don’t forget, how you provoked Yahweh your God to wrath in the wilderness. From the day that you left the land of Egypt until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against Yahweh. 
<span class="verse" id="DT9_8">8&#160;</span>Also in Horeb you provoked Yahweh to wrath, and Yahweh was angry with you to destroy you. 
<span class="verse" id="DT9_9">9&#160;</span>When I had gone up onto the mountain to receive the stone tablets, even the tablets of the covenant which Yahweh made with you, then I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water. 
<span class="verse" id="DT9_10">10&#160;</span>Yahweh delivered to me the two stone tablets written with God’s finger. On them were all the words which Yahweh spoke with you on the mountain out of the middle of the fire in the day of the assembly. </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT9_11">11&#160;</span>It came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights that Yahweh gave me the two stone tablets, even the tablets of the covenant. 
<span class="verse" id="DT9_12">12&#160;</span>Yahweh said to me, “Arise, get down quickly from here; for your people whom you have brought out of Egypt have corrupted themselves.

<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT9_13">13&#160;</span>Furthermore Yahweh spoke to me, saying, “I have seen these people, and behold, they are a stiff-necked people. 
<span class="verse" id="DT9_14">14&#160;</span>Leave me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under the sky; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.” </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT9_15">15&#160;</span>So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire. The two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands. 
<span class="verse" id="DT9_16">16&#160;</span>I looked, and behold, you had sinned against Yahweh your God. You had made yourselves a molded calf. You had quickly turned away from the way which Yahweh had commanded you. 
<span class="verse" id="DT9_17">17&#160;</span>I took hold of the two tablets, and threw them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes. 
<span class="verse" id="DT9_18">18&#160;</span>I fell down before Yahweh, as at the first, forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all your sin which you sinned, in doing that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, to provoke him to anger. 
<span class="verse" id="DT9_19">19&#160;</span>For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure with which Yahweh was angry against you to destroy you. But Yahweh listened to me that time also. 
<span class="verse" id="DT9_20">20&#160;</span>Yahweh was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him. I prayed for Aaron also at the same time. 
<span class="verse" id="DT9_21">21&#160;</span>I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burned it with fire, and crushed it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust. I threw its dust into the brook that descended out of the mountain. 
<span class="verse" id="DT9_22">22&#160;</span>At Taberah, at Massah, and at Kibroth Hattaavah you provoked Yahweh to wrath. 
<span class="verse" id="DT9_23">23&#160;</span>When Yahweh sent you from Kadesh Barnea, saying, “Go up and possess the land which I have given you,” you rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your God, and you didn’t believe him or listen to his voice. 
<span class="verse" id="DT9_24">24&#160;</span>You have been rebellious against Yahweh from the day that I knew you. 
<span class="verse" id="DT9_25">25&#160;</span>So I fell down before Yahweh the forty days and forty nights that I fell down, because Yahweh had said he would destroy you. 
<span class="verse" id="DT9_26">26&#160;</span>I prayed to Yahweh, and said, “Lord Yahweh, don’t destroy your people and your inheritance that you have redeemed through your greatness, that you have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand. 
<span class="verse" id="DT9_27">27&#160;</span>Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Don’t look at the stubbornness of this people, nor at their wickedness, nor at their sin, 
<span class="verse" id="DT9_28">28&#160;</span>lest the land you brought us out from say, ‘Because Yahweh was not able to bring them into the land which he promised to them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.’ 
<span class="verse" id="DT9_29">29&#160;</span>Yet they are your people and your inheritance, which you brought out by your great power and by your outstretched arm.”  </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id='DT10_0'>10</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class="verse" id="DT10_1">1&#160;</span>At that time Yahweh said to me, “Cut two stone tablets like the first, and come up to me onto the mountain, and make an ark of wood. 
<span class="verse" id="DT10_2">2&#160;</span>I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets which you broke, and you shall put them in the ark.” 
<span class="verse" id="DT10_3">3&#160;</span>So I made an ark of acacia wood, and cut two stone tablets like the first, and went up onto the mountain, having the two tablets in my hand. 
<span class="verse" id="DT10_4">4&#160;</span>He wrote on the tablets, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which Yahweh spoke to you on the mountain out of the middle of the fire in the day of the assembly; and Yahweh gave them to me. 
<span class="verse" id="DT10_5">5&#160;</span>I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tablets in the ark which I had made; and there they are as Yahweh commanded me. </div>

<span class="verse" id="DT10_8">8&#160;</span>At that time Yahweh set apart the tribe of Levi to bear the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, to stand before Yahweh to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day.

<span class="verse" id="DT10_10">10&#160;</span>I stayed on the mountain, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights; and Yahweh listened to me that time also. Yahweh would not destroy you.
